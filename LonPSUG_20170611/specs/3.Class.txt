If you wan't a small challenge using clas and script property:

    Scenario: Challenge
        Create a class Named FileProvider
        With a hidden Property Named Path
        so when we do $obj = [FileProvider]::new('C:\existing\path')
        We can 'walk through' the file system via the $obj dot notation
        IN a FS with C:\path C:\path\test.txt C:\path\test2\test2.txt
        $obj = [FileProvider]::new('C:\')
        $Obj.path.test #returns C:\path\test.txt
        $obj.path.test2.test2 #returns C:\path\test2\test2.txt

#the class could be around 20 lines
